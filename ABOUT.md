the site uses java programming language,
java is my first option, and always was.
I think it is powerful programming language, scalable, readable as Poem

about the task, was really good one, unique, and most important gives you alot to learn.
it is my first time deploying java application on the server
at first nothing goes right, the application works fine localy, but not on the server, i read alot, and learn alot and eventually works fine
